I have been working on 3D graphics since 2022, I don't have so powerfull computer but I always try to render out better quality content
Even I don't have such a computer, but I am amazed on 3D graphics, I love modeling, lighting and the best part rendering out and relaxing the output, many people got interested on my artworks and they ask me how did you made these, you can follow me on instagram to observe my workflow
